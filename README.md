# Code Louisville final project
A simple CRUD app created to learn the Django Framework.
Although it is modeled as a todo app, it would make a great skeleton for any CRUD app.

### To run the app:
---
+ `git clone` repo
+ `pip install -r requiements.txt`
+ `cd code_lou_todo`
+ `python manage.py runserver`

and that's it! you should be up and running on `localhost:8000`
